MainFrame = Polynomial Regression
settings = Settings
autoAdjusting = Auto Adjusting
adjustToolTip = Determine automaticly the best function for the given dataset according to the settings.
changeWindow = change Window
setValues = set Values
delPoints = delete Points
delMessage = Do you really want to delete all points?
delPointsTitle = delete points?
options = Options
apply = Apply
degree = Degree
degreeTooltip = The degree of the function.
threshold = Threshold
thresholdTooltip = The program should not provide an exact function, but only a balancing line (see overfitting). Accordingly, a higher degree is taken for the function only when the threshold is exceeded.
maxDegree = Max Degree
maxDegreeTooltip = If the function is determined automatically, then this function will not go beyond this degree.
reset = reset

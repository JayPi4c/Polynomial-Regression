Frame.title = Polynomial Regression
Frame.settings = Settings
Frame.autoAdjusting = Auto Adjusting
Frame.adjustToolTip = Determine automaticly the best function for the given dataset according to the settings.
Frame.changeWindow = window settings
Frame.setValues = set Values
Frame.delPoints = delete Points
Frame.delMessage = Do you really want to delete all points?
Frame.delPointsTitle = delete points?
Frame.options = Options
SettingsPanel.apply = Apply
SettingsFrame.degree = Degree
SettingsFrame.degreeTooltip = The degree of the function.
SettingsFrame.threshold = Threshold
SettingsFrame.thresholdTooltip = The program should not provide an exact function, but only a balancing line (see overfitting). Accordingly, a higher degree is taken for the function only when the threshold is exceeded.
SettingsFrame.maxDegree = Max Degree
SettingsFrame.maxDegreeTooltip = If the function is determined automatically, then this function will not go beyond this degree.
SettingsPanel.reset = reset
SettingsFrame.applyAll = apply all
